   workspace
     A directory (by default |socok8s_workspace_default| ) that is structured like an `ansible-runner`
     directory.
     The default workspace directory can be changed by setting the environment
     variable `SOCOK8S_ENVNAME`. The workspace directory name is always `${SOCOK8S_ENVNAME}-workspace`.
